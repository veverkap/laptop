# Onboard

This repository contains scripts to help set up your dev environment.

## Getting Started

This should only be run if you have installed _nothing_.
If you have iTerm, Docker, or some of the other stuff it adds, it could break.
Otherwise, everything is very quick and one click!

- `./laptop`

## What Will This Do?

- Install required base software
