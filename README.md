# Onboard

Welcome to Flatiron Labs! This repository contains scripts to help set up your dev environment. For more information check out [the docs](https://docs.learn.co/general/onboarding/)

## Getting Started

This should only be run if you have installed _nothing_.
If you have iTerm, Docker, or some of the other stuff it adds, it could break.
Otherwise, everything is very quick and one click!

- `./laptop`

## What Will This Do?

- Install required base software
- Clone all Learn-related repositories
- Run each project's `bin/setup` script
